Taylor series calculates the series upon given function and percision.

SqrtOfPiE calculates the value upon given percision, pi is calculated with Euler's formula and e with Taylor series expansion.

SumOfNaturalNum calculates partial sums of n given natural numbers and aproximates a parabola using least squares theorem for sequential natural numbers with partial sums of the given natural number. Then it caluculates the difference between the computed value and theorethical value of -1/12.
