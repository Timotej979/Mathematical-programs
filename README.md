# Mathematical-programs
Simple mathematical programs created in free time.

**_C programming language (Using 128 bit floating point percission):_**
    
  - **Taylor series** calculates the series upon given function and percision.

  - **SqrtOfPiE** calculates the value upon given percision, pi is calculated with Euler's formula and e with Taylor series expansion.

  - **SumOfNaturalNum** calculates partial sums of n given natural numbers and aproximates a parabola using least squares theorem for sequential natural numbers with partial sums of the given natural number. Then it caluculates the difference between the computed value and theorethical value of -1/12.


**_Numerical methods in Matlab:_**
  
  - **LU decomposition** with direct and reverse insertion with tridiagonal version of those.
    
  - **Cholesky decomposition** for tridiagonal positive definite matrices
    
  - **Bisection** for finding zeroes of a function
    
  - **Secant method** for finding zeroes of a function

  - **Tangent method** for finding zeroes of a function

  - **Newton method** for finding function intersections
